I used python 3.8, but it should work for any python 3 version.

Apart from python STDL following import statements were used / external packages are required:

--> numpy
--> matplotlib
--> scipy

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist, squareform
